This small ethernet packet sniffer works on my machine.

It creates a listening socket on the ethernet connection, then listens for ethernet packets.

It can also read the IPs of IPv4 packets, as well as ARP packets, and save both to text files as well as showing them on the console.

I tried to put comments so to remind myself and explain what each thing does.
